COMMUNITY HERO: OUR HERO
BARACK OBAMA


Obama is a motivator by being a public speaker. He's willing to wake up every morning to run the country. He was the first African American to be head of Harvard Law Review. He's also a motivator because he never forgot his roots and we were moved that he went to Kenya to visit his father's grave and merge the history of Africans and African Americans. He once wrote that people should not only hear his voice as a black man but as a voice of the people. He has motivated us to embrace our families and to show how much we love each other. It is clear that he loves his wife Michelle and loves their two daughters.
Barack Obama is brave because he took a chance and a risk that his life might be taken as he ran for President and became the President-Elect of the United States of America.
Barack Obama sacrificed his own personal freedom to become President. He now has to give up walking in the park or going to play basketball alone or just with his buddies.
Barack Obama has courage. As the President, he is taking on the job during tough economic times. We hope that change will come in the form of lower taxes, lower food costs and gas costs, better schools and affordable housing.
Barack Obama is an inspiration. We worked on election day pulling out the vote and we were proud to be a part of history. It's a moment we will never forget. Mr. Obama's election restored confidence in the American Dream and the Constitution of the United States of America. It was inspiring to see people from around the globe cheering, crying, embracing each other and saying YES WE CAN! 
We are personally inspired because as young African American and Latino men living in the inner city, where two deaths and three shootings have taken place in the last three weeks, we know that because of Barack Obama, we don't have to sit on the sidelines; we can get involved in our communities, our neighborhoods, our states, and the world and make a difference.
