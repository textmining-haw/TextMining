Lupe Fiasco calls President Obama a terrorist

Lupe Fiasco has never bitten his tongue about his disdain for modern politics, and his latest single "Words I Never Said," offers a few of his thoughts on the subject.
"Limbaugh is a racist, Glenn Beck is a racist, Gaza Strip was getting burned, Obama didn't say ?/ That's why I ain't vote for him, next one either," he raps on the controversial track from his latest album, "Lasers."
The rapper has opened himself up to even more scrutiny after appearing on CBS News' "What's Trending." In the interview, which aired Tuesday night (you can watch it here), he revealed more about his frustrations with the administration, calling President Obama the biggest terrorist in the country.
"In my fight against terrorism, to me, the biggest terrorist is Obama in the United States of America. For me, I'm trying to fight the terrorism that's actually causing the other forms of terrorism. The root cause of the terrorism is the stuff that you as a government allow to happen and the foreign policies that we have in place in different countries that inspire people to become terrorists. And it's easy for us because it's really just some oil, which we can really get on our own."

When asked by the show's host, Shira Lazar, if, as the lyrics suggested, he doesn't vote, Fiasco responded in the affirmative.
"I don't get involved in the political process because it's meaningless, to be honest. First of all I'm a real big believer if I'm gonna vouch for someone, then I'm gonna stand behind everything that they do. That's just how I am as a human being. So politicians aren't gonna do that because I don't want you to bomb some village in the middle of nowhere."
He took it even further, though, wondering what would happen if no one voted. His suggestion? "Let's try it out."
Of course, Fiasco's sentiments echo Kanye West's outburst against President Bush, which became late-night fodder for weeks.
Fiasco was a trending topic on Twitter Wednesday and people appear divided by his statements. Some are praising him for speaking out for his own personal beliefs, while others have written off his comments as "stupid" or "moronic." But we want to hear from readers. Will Fiasco's words prove troublesome for him?
