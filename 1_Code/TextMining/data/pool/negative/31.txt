(Biz Pac Review) " Conservative firebrand Ann Coulter accused President Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder of putting black teen Michael Brown's shooting death by a white police officer on par with the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil.
"I think the whole thing was brought about by Obama and Holder turning a self-defense shooting by a cop in this small town into another 9/11," Coulter said Friday on the "O'Reilly Factor." 'They had 45 FBI agents investigating... [and] all they come up with is [Ferguson, Mo.] Officer Darren Wilson was completely in the right."
"The witnesses who said that 'Big Mike' had his hands up were lying, were completely full of it," Coulter said. "This was all from Eric Holder's report."
Coulter said American race relations were at their best in the wake of O.J. Simpson's murder acquittal, "when white America finally said, 'That's it, we've paid at the office, we're done,' and suddenly, blacks stopped being infantilized, and they were treated like adults."
America's first black president changed all that, she said.
"Well Obama, and the media sucking up to Obama, and their general love for racial demagoguery have brought us back to the '70s," Coulter said.
