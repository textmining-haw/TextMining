LaPierre says no rifle ammo safe from president’s pen
(Fox News) – Wayne LaPierre, Executive Vice President of the National Rifle Association, appeared on “Varney & Co.” to weigh in on President Obama using his executive authority to try and ban certain bullets for the AR-15 rifle.
LaPierre told Stuart Varney that Obama is “grasping at straws,” since he has been unable to ban the AR-15 in the past.
“This is a president that hates the Second Amendment, hates the constitutional right of Americans to own firearms,” LaPierre said. “He can’t win at the ballot box, he can’t win in Congress, so he’s putting on his dictator’s hat and he’s going to do it by fiat. And we’re not going to let it happen.”
LaPierre explained that the ammunition in question, the 5.56 M855 “lightgreen tip,” is no more armor-piercing or dangerous to law enforcement than any other round, contrary to what Obama’s proposal may say.
“He’s simply trying to rewrite the rules to ban ammunition. And if he can ban this ammunition under this false premise, he can ban all ammunition.”
LaPierre echoed what he said at his CPAC 2015 speech (watch below), stating that the American public is facing “an epidemic of untruth at the highest levels in this country.”
LaPierre quoted George Orwell, “The farther society gets from the truth, the more they will punish those who speak it.”
