Actor slams ‘Barry Satera Kenya’ for focusing on basketball tournament
(The Hill) – Charlie Sheen is continuing to blast President Obama, saying Americans “deserve better” from the commander in chief.
In what’s become an annual tradition, Obama released his bracket for the NCAA tournament earlier this week. Sheen, the ex-star of “Two and a Half Men,” had lambasted Obama for the men’s basketball bracket in a Thursday tweet.
“I don’t care about the picks,” Sheen told TMZ.com in video posted Friday. “When the world is in the state it’s in right now — it just makes me insane. It’s not cool. It’s not fair to the families and to who we are as a republic.”
On Thursday Sheen had tweeted to his more than 11 million followers:
“It’s not fair and we deserve better from our president,” the 49-year-old actor said in TMZ’s video, “and I demand it.”
