(Daily Caller) – During a joint press conference at the White House with the President of Afghanistan that was intended to demonstrate the close cooperation between the two nations, President Barack Obama accidentally called his counterpart by the wrong name.
Obama met with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani earlier in the day to discuss U.S. troop withdrawals in the war-torn country. But at the press conference, Obama referred to him as “Karzai,” the name of his predecessor Hamid Karzai.
“President Karzai,” he said while gesturing to the man standing next to him, “who has taken on the mantle of commander-in-chief as we’ve not seen in the past from an Afghan president, can do a serious review and assess here’s where our strengths are, here’s where our weaknesses are, and we can proceed with more effective joint planning going forward.”
