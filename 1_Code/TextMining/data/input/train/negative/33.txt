'Is it a direct threat? I'm not sure it's even a veiled threat'
(CBS News) "Police in Fairfield, Connecticut, are investigating the discovery of two dead skunks with a sign reading "Obama Stinks."
One skunk had string wrapped around its neck and was nailed to a telephone pole, while the other was found at the base. The sign with the anti-Obama message was attached to the pole and also had an American flag with a hammer and sickle in place of the stars.
A woman who noticed the dead animals called Fairfield police at 8:40 Tuesday morning.
Fairfield Police Lt. James Perez said authorities aren't sure what to make of the sign.
"Is it a direct threat? I'm not sure it's even a veiled threat. We really don't know what it is at this point," Perez told WCBS 880's Alex Silverman.
However, it does seem to be clear case of animal cruelty, Silverman reported.
"In this day and age with so many people leading complex lives, it's silly that you would have someone make such a bold statement using a defenseless animal," Perez said.
Anyone with information that may be helpful is urged to contact police or animal control.
