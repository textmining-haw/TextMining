(Daily Caller) – Most Americans want the next president to change President Obama’s policies, according to a new poll.
Fifty-seven percent of those polled said their ideal candidate “would change most of the policies of the Obama administration,” while 41 percent said their ideal candidate “would continue most of the Obama administration,” according to the CNN poll, conducted between March 13 and 15.
Of the 1,095 Americans polled, 28 percent identified as Democrats, 24 percent as Republicans, and the rest as Independents or not registered voters.
They were asked to imagine they could “create the perfect candidate” to replace Obama, and then asked to choose the better of two statements in a series of choices.
Most of those polled also said they prefer a candidate with a lot of experience as an executive, rather than as a legislator, and that they prefer a candidate who believes religious views have no place in government. Fifty-nine percent said they want a candidate who has been in the public eye as a political leader for many years.
