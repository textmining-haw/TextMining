Republican caught in unguarded moment slamming president for lies
(Daily Caller) – Ben Carson thinks President Obama is a “psychopath.”
In a new GQ profile of the potential 2016 Republican presidential candidate, reporter Jason Zengerle shares an unguarded moment with Carson, during which the famed neurosurgeon called President Barack Obama a “psychopath” for his ability to shamelessly lie to the American people.
Carson reportedly went off on the president after his adviser Armstrong Williams said the president “looks good” during his State of the Union address.
“Like most psychopaths. That’s the way they look, they all look great,” Carson replied.
“He’s gotta convince people to believe him,” Williams reportedly responded, “That’s all he’s doing: selling his narrative.”
“But he knows he’s telling a lie!” Carson said. “He’s trying to sell what he thinks is not true! He’s sitting there saying, ‘These Americans are so stupid, I can tell them anything.’”
Williams seemed to recognize the comments might be controversial and told Carson not to repeat them during an interview later. “We don’t have to call him a psychopath. I don’t want you to go to CNN with that kind of mood.”
