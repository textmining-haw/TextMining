        <h1>Understanding, Analyzing, and Retrieving Knowledge from Social Media</h1>
	<hr>
        </center>

	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<p> Social Media has become one of the most popular platforms to allow users 
to communicate, and share their interests without being at the same 
geographical location. 
With the rapid growth of Social Media sites such as Facebook, 
LinkedIn, Twitter, Customer reviews (e.g. Amazon, CNET) and Blogs (e.g. WSJ Blogs), there is 
vast amount of 
user-generated content. Our goal is to retrieve valuable nuggets of 
knowledge from this huge amount of data and help users make informed decisions.
To achieve this goal, the specfic objectives of the project are as follows.
	</p><ul>
	<li>Constructing useful information networks from raw datasets.</li>
    	<li>Understanding and analysizing useful structures, patterns, and communities in networks.</li>
	<li>Analysis of temporal and special dynamics in networks.</li>
    	<li>Analysis of social reputation, influence, and trust.</li>
	<li>User activity modeling, profiling, exploration, and recommendation systems.</li>
	<li>Developing new data mining and machine learning algorithms for social networks.</li>
 	<li>New applications and impact of social media in other areas of research.</li>
	</ul>
	<p></p>

	Our current progress on this project can be categorized in two broad categories.
	<h3>Community Mining</h3>
	<p> The rapid evolution of modern social networks motivates the design and understanding of networks based on users' 
interest. Using popular social media such as Facebook and Twitter, we present new perspective to bring out more meaningful 
information about the networks. Instead of using traditional user networks of Facebook and Twitter, we deduce user interest 
based networks using posts, comments, and tweets. Our approach is able to closely capture relations found in static networks 
and also finds affiliations that are constantly evolving either due to temporal or spatial activities. Further, we develop a 
new approach for mining communities to understand and analyze the structure of social networks. Our user-interest based model 
and community extraction algorithm together can be used to identify target communities in the context of business requirements. 
Figure 1 shows several such focused communities that belong to categories such as 
Technology (c231), Consumer Merchandize (c232), 
Retail (c243), Travel and Leisure (c244), Food (c248) and Baby Products (c251). We got many more interesting <a href="http://pulse.eecs.northwestern.edu/%7Edrp925/inc/graph.php" target="_blank">focused communities</a>.
 Note that using the existing approaches, most of these focused 
communities belong to one large community, which does not reflect the 
structure of the network. </p>

	</center>
<p></p>
<p></p>
In addition, we also explore newer methods to extract communities from a
 given network. In many real networks vertices may belong to more than 
one group, and such groups form overlapping communities. Classical 
examples are social networks, where an individual usually belongs to 
different circles at the same time, from that of work colleagues to 
family, sport associations, etc. Finding such overlapping community is a
 challenging problem, and is not supported by traditional community 
detection algorithms. We devised a hierarchical pruning based heuristic 
algorithm for finding the maximum clique for a given graph. The details 
on the maximum clique algorithm and source code are available <a href="http://cucis.ece.northwestern.edu/projects/MAXCLIQUE/index.html">online</a>.
 
We are currently working on extending the clique algorithm to identify 
the communities for massive networks. 
Using this, we also devised a clique-based community detection algorithm
 which is capable of finding overlapping communities. Figure 2 shows 
some of the communities detected. We see two isolated communities, one 
for popular singers, and another for retail chains and products. We also
 see a community for news channels and politics, and a community of 
MSNBC and popular TV shows. The highlight of our algorithms is that it 
allows a node to be a member of more than one community giving an 
overlapping community structure. Although the "news channels and 
politics" and "MSNBC and tv shows" communities are not directly related 
and have different members, they share a common member.
<p></p>
<!--ul>	
	<h4>Detecting communities using faster clique algorithm</h4>
	As mentioned above, communities in a network relfect the structure and 
the communication pattern of the network elements. Many algorithms have been developed to 
extract communities from various networks: for example, social networks, epidemic networks, 
bioinformatics, and communication networks. However, the massive growth of these networks made the community detection problem
computationally challenging. Recently, we develped a faster maximum clique algorithm capable of identifying
maximum clique (eventually a strongly connected community) from massive networks within seconds. The details 
on the maximum clique algorithm and source code are available <a href="../MAXCLIQUE/index.html" target="_blank">online</a>. 
We are currently working on extending the clique algorithm to identify the communities for massive networks.

Figure 2 presnts some preliminary results showing some communities (cliques) detected. We observe two isolated communities 
for one for popular singers, and another for retail chains and products. We also observe that a community for news 
channels and politics, 
and a community of MSNBC and popular TV shows. 
The highlight of our algorithms is that it allows a network element, for example, <i>msnbc</i>, to be a member of 
multiple communities, an additional feature to identify the overlapping community structure.

        <h3>Text Mining</h3>
        <p>Enormous amounts of messages get published each day on social media sites. For example, Twitter processes 230 million 
tweets (messages that are 140 characters long) a day (<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/08/twitter-stats_n_954121.html" target="_blank">twitterstats</a><a>).
The explosion of textual messages can cause information overload. Our goal is to design systems that can analyze and summarize 
social media content. The current work encompasses two main themes:
	</a></p><ul><a>
	<h4>Sentiment Analysis</h4>
		<ul>
		<li>The goal is to mine opinions from social media data at sentence and document level.</li> 
		<li>Design a framework that can determine the sentiment (positive, 
negative,
or neutral) overcoming social slang and lingos, non-textual expressions and language.</li>
		<h4>SES Framework</h4>
		The Sentiment Elicitation System (SES) is a sentiment identification 
framework which consists of three sentiment identification algorithms. 
First algorithm is 
based on Compositional Semantic Rules. The rule set is augmented to 
overcome poor grammar and 
part-of-speech tagging and results in numeric score in the range -10 to 
+10.  The second 
algorithm associates numeric score in the range -5 to +5 for textual 
sentiments 
by incorporating user star ratings in reviews along with word appear 
frequency. The third 
algorithm makes use of emoticons, negation word position and 
domain-specific words and 
characterizes the sentiment as positive, negative or neutral. A 
predictive model (e.g. Decision Tree, Neural Network) is trained on 3 
basic features i.e. output of each of the three algorithms namely S1, S2
 and S3 and two derived features: a) S1 + S2 b) S2 - S1 to predict 
sentiment.

		Figure 3: SES Architechture.
		</center>
		</ul>
	<h4>Text classification</h4>	
		</a><ul><a>
		<li>The goal is to group similar text or messages that can make information more manageable. </li> 
		<li>Employ framework that can cluster similar text belong to the same 
topic and several similar topics that can belong to a broad category.</li>
		
		<h4>Constraint Mixture Clustering Framework</h4>
		The proposed framework utilizes priori information such as label signs or pairwise constraints that can 
easily obtained from the social media sites with very little human intervention. For example, messages on 
Barak Obama's Facebook page and comments made by other users on these messages are 
constrained to the class <i>politics</i>. 
The framework integrates pairwise constraints and labels to infer data for learning.  The framework uses model-based 
clustering/classification in which the data is generated by a model and tries to recover the 
original model from the data. 
The model recovered defines the clusters and assignment of data points to clusters.  The proposed framework shows significant 
improvement over baseline classifiers such as semi-supervised K-Means and Transductive SVM. 
More details regarding the framework 
can be found in [</a><a href="http://cucis.ece.northwestern.edu/publications/pdf/CheZha11.pdf">pdf</a>]. For 
future work, the goal of the framework would be to 
derive 
the pairwise constraints automatically from auxiliary information for many real world applications.

		<h4>Text and Network based Classification Framework </h4>

 <p></p>
	The goal of this framework is to classify trending topics (news or event for which 
messages are in high volume) on Twitter 
into known categories such as <em>sports, politics</em> etc. The framework is capable of 
classifying topics using traditional 
text-based techniques as well as a novel technique which uses Twitter specific network information (network-based).  
In text-based approach textual data such as topic definition, tweets and pre-assigned labels form the text document. 
Document is transformed into word tokens along with their frequencies to infer data for learning. The framework then 
uses traditional classification kernels (e.g. Naive Bayes, SVM) to predict the topic class 
based on the previously trained
 examples. In the network-based approach, the topic class is predicted based on the class of topics similar to it. 
Similarity between two topics is defined using User Similarity metric which assumes that if there is significant overlap 
among influential users generating content on two topics, then there is close relationship between these two topics.  
Therefore, the network based model can predict the class of the target topic using the categories of its similar topics.  
For example, Figure 5 shows the number of common influential users that generated content regarding target 
topic <em>Macbook</em> and its similar topics.  Using the common influential count and class of the similar topics, 
the classifier (e.g. Decision Tree) develops model to predict category for future topics.  
The experiments on Twitter dataset reveal higher prediction accuracy for network based classification compared to 
text-based classification technique.  More details regarding the framework can be found in 
[<a href="http://cucis.ece.northwestern.edu/publications/pdf/LeePal11.pdf">pdf</a>]. Since the network model is dependent on 
finding similar topics, 
our next step would be to integrate the two models in the framework so that text based model can be 
employed when the network based model cannot be employed.
